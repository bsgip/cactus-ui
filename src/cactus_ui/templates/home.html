  <h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>
  <p class="lead">Run your CSIP-Australia client against our testing harness in three steps.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Download Your Client Certificate</h2>
  <p>
    CSIP-Australia (based on IEEE 2030.5) uses mutual TLS for authentication.
    Download your certificate from the <a href="/certificate">Certificate page</a> and install it in your client.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Certificates expire. Revisit the page to refresh and download a new one when needed.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Enable your domain for notifications (Optional)</h2>
  <p>
    IEEE 2030.5 allows the registration of arbitrary URIs to receive HTTP notifications. This tool will allow you to
    register a single authorised domain that can be used to receive these notifications. You can configure this domain
    from the <a href="/domain">Domain page</a>

    <br><br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Attempting to create a subscription using a notification URI outside of this configured
    domain will raise an error.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Review Test Procedures</h2>
  <p>
    Go to the <a href="/procedures">Test Procedures</a> page for the full list of available procedures with
    descriptions.
    These follow the <em>DEIP Interoperability Steering Committee – Common Smart Inverter Profile (Australia) – Test
      Procedures</em>, version 1.2.
    <!-- TODO: Add link to doc -->
  </p>

  <h2>4. Use the Runs Page</h2>
  <p>
    Go to the <a href="/runs">Runs page</a> to manage everything test-related:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trigger a new test run by selecting a procedure from the dropdown and clicking <strong>Start Run</strong>.
      You'll be given a test URL to point your client at.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> It can take up to 30 seconds for your test environment to be ready.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Once the client has completed the procedure steps, click <strong>Finalise</strong> to compile results. A ZIP
      file will be returned.</li>
    <li>Download past results at any time from the same page.</li>
  </ul>
